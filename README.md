# Generate synthetic toy version of EVS data

Generate datasets that look like EVS data but can be shared easily

## Replication

1. Download the repository
2. Download the target data and place it in the `data` folder
3. Run `1-generate-data.R` to generate a toy dataset as a subsample of the original data
4. Run `2-generate-synthetic.R` to create a synthetic version of the toy dataset.
